    version 1.2.1
    * Updated the Windows build instructions for newer versions of
      Visual Studio (with integrated CMake support), and rewrote the
      README in Markdown.
    * Fixed partition naming to be more useful (rather than just 36
      UTF-16 dagger (U+0x2020) characters like before). Thanks Phillip
      Hellewell for finding and fixing it!

    version 1.2
    * Added support for compiling with GCC 5 (on Linux and Windows)
      and Visual Studio (on Windows).
    * Converted the build system from hand-coded makefiles to CMake.
      This should be more flexible in generating project files for
      various IDEs.
